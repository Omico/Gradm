Gradm (**Gra**dle **d**ependencies **m**anager) is a new way to manage dependencies easier and more efficient.

## Why Gradm?

The Gradle version catalogs is an excellent move for us. But it also brings a lot of problems, and becomes more and more painful:

* The Generated code is fully Java. Usable, and that's it. Not good for reading.
* ~~No official dependencies update support.~~
* Terrible restrictions, like naming: <https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/18208>, <https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/18201>.
* And more...?

**Gradm** was born for the above problems. It has an excellent ability of dependencies management and versions update.
